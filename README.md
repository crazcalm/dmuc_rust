# dmuc_rust
This is a port of another project of mine called [Discover My Unix Commands](https://github.com/crazcalm/DiscoverMyUnixCommands) and my Go port of it called [dmuc](https://github.com/crazcalm/dmuc)

## What does this Application do?
This application allows you to list out the applications in the /usr/bin and /usr/local/bin directories. You may also use the "starts with" or "includes" filters to filter your results.

## Purpose:
I am porting this tool to Rust as a means to become more familiar with Rust. Also, post creating the MVP, I think I can turn this into a tutorial on how to create Rust Terminal Application.
